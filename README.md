# Airbnb recruiting competition

This my attempt to solve the problem mentioned here https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/overview.

# Approach
After reading the data I examined it and visulized it. Based on that I started to fix and clean some of the issues with data.
I used Decision Trees, KNN and a simple NN model.

# Results
Decision Trees :  Accuracy = 72.6%      NDCG = 82.4%
KNN :             Accuracy = 87.7%      NDCG = 89.9%
NN :             Accuracy = 87.8%      NDCG = 92.8%

# Code
Code is commented and availble in the ipynb
